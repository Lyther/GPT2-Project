# GPT2-Project

Use GPT-2 Chinese model to train and show with GUI. This is my CS303 Artificial Intelligence project, using existing GPT-2 Chinese model Morizeyao/GPT2-Chinese.

This version of GPT2 model uses about 80 million parameters, which is much smaller than the 1.5 billion parameters version. So the training would be more efficient.

Currently, I have 3 models already trained:
* Prose model
* Network novel: Break the Sky
* Network novel: Thriller Paradise

----

Usage:
1. download GPT-2 Chinese from repo Morizeyao/GPT2-Chinese.
2. Replace model with folder in models.
3. Run train.py and generate something.

TODO:
* GUI design for my project.
